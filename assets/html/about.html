        <section>
            <p>I am Marcos, 23 years old and a computer science student at UNICAMP (Universidade Estadual de Campinas), currently in the last year of the course.
                Due to the Computer Science course, my main knowledge currently focus on back-end algorithms and my main programming language is Python.
            </p>
            <p>The main reason I chose to course Computer Science was my passion for video games and consequently the curiosity for fixing computers (when they would crash). In the first semester of the course, I find out that my main inspiration in programming was to resolve problems through computers. </p>

            <p>Currently, I'm studying Economics for Engineering and Introduction to IA in the university. Due to being on the final of the course I just have these two disciplines for this semester.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I'm looking to learn more about Flask and Django (Python lib and framework), HTML and JavaScript, besides RESTful application concepts. I believe this to be very import in the context of web development and currently have special interest on these topics.</p>
